It’s extern.\nWith the opposite meaning of static, we can get the right understanding.</p>\n\n<p>Here, it means ‘fixed’, or ‘local’. The target with static keyword has the local feature.\nThe</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"extern-keyword\">Extern keyword</h3>\n\n<p>Extern keyword makes the target global.\nAs the word means literally, the target with ‘extern’ keyword become global and visible to other files.</p>\n\n<p>[]:http://www.answers.com/Q/What_is_the_difference_between_static_and_local_declaration\n[]:\n[]:</p>\n"
